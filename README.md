# 15puzzle

A helper tool to help developers to verifiy their solutions of 15 puzzle

Small enough to work

I'm using GPL2.0 so don't forget to send your updates

How to use it:
==============
1. In the Text Area input your 15 puzzle initial state [1-15] and x as the blank tile (comma separated) .
2. Click on Generate to build the puzzle.
3. write the solution sequence [left,right,up,down] (comma separated).
4. Click on Apply solution.

please note that this software is not full tested. I just created this software to help me solve the 15 puzzle, since the manual checking was exhausting and a waste of time.
